Self-Track

A simple, secure and safe way to keep track of what you are working on, currently on Windows and Linux.

# Why was this built

There are a multitude of tracking apps out there. All of which do a decent job at what they set out to do. However, it has always irked me that something as sensative as what I do on my computer, gets beamed up on the cloud, with only blind faith to hold on to the idea that that information is for my eyes only. Therefore, I set out to build a very simple tracking app, that keeps all data local ALWAYS, and can only distribute its findings if you do so manually. Apart from this, the app is also a 100% open source, so that the process is fully trustless and transparent.

Of course there are positives and negatives to this approach, and I will outline them here:

# Positives

- Security and Safety (as aforementioned)
- Growth - Given its open source nature, all the positives that come with open source projects are given to this app. Consistant updates, continuous feedback and fresh new ideas are all valid and encouraged ways to contribute to Self-Track.
- Unexploitable - Tracking Apps have a long history of being used by employers to micro-manage their employees, being annoying at best and exploitative at worst. With Self-Track, this is impossible, since the data Self-Track gathers will ALWAYS be available to you only, and will only be deliverable to someone else later.

# Negatives

- No Cloud Backup - Of course, keeping everything local does mean that your system is the one and only backup of your data. Users are responsible to backup their data elsewhere in the event of issues with the device, or the device in question becomes compromised in any way.

# How to use

All you have to do is download the corresponding to your platform, start recording, and go about your business.

Note: For Linux systems, specific permissions must be given to the current user in order for interactivity information to be tracked. This is outlined when the program starts. This program can work without it, but interactivity will not be tracked.

Data is stored in userData directory of your system, and it is easily reachable from within the Application for easy of use.
